  "executive_summary": "Delivery performance is constrained by two intertwined systemic limits: (1) unstable, non–production-like test/integration baselines that drive code freezes and change failures; and (2) insufficient and fragmented product discovery/refinement capacity that yields inconsistent, over-large slices and noisy planning data. These interact with a push system and high WIP to amplify variability, rush, and rework. The result is very high change failure (100%), long lead times (~40 days), slow recovery (~12.5 days), zero PBIs meeting Done per sprint, and low predictability that erodes stakeholder trust and increases reporting overhead, further starving discovery time.",
