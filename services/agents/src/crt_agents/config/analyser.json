  "executive_summary": "Primary constraint appears to be governance/reporting overhead that crowds out product discovery and focused delivery capacity. Despite healthy delivery capability (short lead times, short-lived branches, low MTTR, mid commit frequency, strong Westrum score), deployment frequency is low and a large share of time is spent in meetings, tech debt, and unplanned work. This pattern suggests a policy/management constraint (reporting to show control and possible release gating) rather than a technical one. Increasing time on understanding user needs and reducing control-oriented reporting would likely reduce unplanned work, improve change quality, and enable higher deployment frequency without compromising stability.",
